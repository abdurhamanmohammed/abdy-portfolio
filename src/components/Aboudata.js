        <p>
        Hi, I am Abdurhaman Mohammed and I work as a web developer. I am a electrical and computer engineer
        who loves to create websites as well as apps for people. I think that
        people should look at the bigger picture when they are building
        something. I love to work in groups where everyone can voice their
        opinions and ideas. In the end, I love to work towards one goal where in
        the end we all can contribute towards making a good website.
